## Projects
**[NFT Profitability - SQL Project](https://github.com/Mokakash/NFT_Profitability_Project_SQL)**

Similar to stocks or crypto trading, in the world of NFTs, understanding the best trading methods and where to spend your time efficiently in countless alpha groups for upcoming project insights is crucial due to daily time constraints. Using SQL, I dove deep into my 2022 NFT trading data to uncover the most profitable trading methods (Mint vs. Secondary Trades vs. Airdrops), identify seasonal trends, and discover the best alpha groups to gather early intel on upcoming NFTs.
To address the primary objectives of this project, I have cleaned the raw data followed by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**[Web Scraping Price Tracker - Python Project](https://github.com/Mokakash/Web_Scraping_Price_Tracker_Project_Pyhton)**

This Python project originated from a personal need to track the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 on the Amazon U.S. website. Initially desiring to purchase the Apple Watch Ultra 2 without paying its full MSRP of $799, I’ve decided to build this project to monitor its price changes and receive email notifications if it dropped below the original price. The project aimed to assist in securing the watch at a discounted rate, bypassing the need to pay the full retail price. Through Python, this project streamlines the process of monitoring online prices, offering updates via email notifications.

## Work Experience
**DATA ANALYST III – ANALYTICS PEOPLE LEADER**

**Quest Diagnostics (Jul 2021 - Present)**
+ Lead the HRSC Reporting and Analytics team, managing a team of 3 data analysts.
+ Designed and implemented an automated ETL pipeline using Python, Alteryx Desktop, and RPA (Power Automate), to automate the extraction of multiple data sources from multiple data management systems and data sources into Tableau Server. This resulted in a 65% reduction in reporting processing time and achieved a 100% data accuracy rate. 
+ Designed, developed, and maintained an interactive operational performance dashboard using Tableau Desktop and server. The dashboard encompassed KPIs, scorecards, trends, and operational metrics, garnering approximately 1000 monthly views across 8 functional teams (Benefit, Systems, ER, Learning & Development, CPI, Onboarding, R&A, and Service Desk). Recognized as the authoritative data source for the department, it facilitated direct exports for functional and senior leaders, leading to a 20% reduction in ad-hoc requests and a 40% improvement in turnaround time. 
+ Developed and deployed the Oracle LIVE dashboard and reporting system, utilizing SQL and Oracle OTBI, equipped stakeholders with up-to-the-moment visualizations and the ability to export real-time reports, resulting in a 20% reduction in ad-hoc requests.
+ Implemented an Alteryx Bursting workflow integrating an input tool to retrieve data directly from the SharePoint website, eliminating the need for manual data export. Cleaned data and utilized custom Alteryx Macros to calculate ticket aging, delivering tailored reports to targeted audiences based on Region and Pay Grade. This workflow saved 20 minutes daily on data gathering and preparation, and 40 minutes on filtering, sifting through data, and emailing the relevant population to the right audience. 
+ Utilized Python to perform extensive EDA on SurveyMonkey open-ended customer feedback data, identifying the most frequently occurring feedback, keywords, and customer concerns, enabled the LDC team to take targeted actions towards improving highlighted areas for enhancement, saving 8 hours weekly by eliminating the need for recurring manual review of extensive datasets.
+ Developed customized self-service performance Tableau and Power BI dashboards for individual teams, empowered functional leaders to independently review team performance, view updated visualization, export data, and track trends within their respective teams, which led to a significant reduction of 5 hours per week in JIT reporting and communications across all teams. 
+ Led monthly 1-hour operational overview calls using my comprehensive Tableau dashboard, spotlighted performance metrics, trends, and areas for improvement, to equip cross-functional leaders with valuable insights for better data-driven decisions.
